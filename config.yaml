  description: Hugo is a general-purpose website framework. Technically speaking,
    Hugo is a static site generator. Unlike systems that dynamically build a page
    with each visitor request, Hugo builds pages when you create or update your content.
    Since websites are viewed far more often than they are edited, Hugo is designed
    to provide an optimal viewing experience for your websiteâ€™s end users and an ideal
    writing experience for website authors.
